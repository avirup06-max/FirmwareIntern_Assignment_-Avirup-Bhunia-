# Gerber Export Guide (EasyEDA)

This board uses a standard 2-layer stackup with a *solid GND plane* on the bottom. Use these settings to export Gerbers and a drill file your fab (e.g., JLCPCB/PCBWay) will accept.

## EasyEDA
1. *Fabrication → Generate Fabrication File (Gerber)*.
2. Ensure these layers are enabled: *TopLayer, BottomLayer, TopSilkLayer, BottomSilkLayer, TopSolderMaskLayer, BottomSolderMaskLayer, BoardOutline*.
3. *Drill: Excellon format; units **mm*.
4. Download the ZIP from EasyEDA.

## Fabrication Notes to Include
- *Material:* FR-4, Tg ≥ 135 °C
- *Layers:* 2
- *Thickness:* 1.6 mm
- *Copper:* 1 oz (35 µm) both sides
- *Finish:* ENIG or HASL (lead-free)
- *Solder mask:* any color; silkscreen white
- *Impedance control:* not strictly required; keep D+/D− as short, parallel tracks
- *Panelization:* let the fab do it unless you need multiples

## Pre-Flight Checklist
- [ ] DRC clean (no unconnected nets, no mask slivers, no overlaps)
- [ ] Text readable (no mirrored references unless intended)
- [ ] Fiducials added if planning assembly
- [ ] Mounting holes correct
- [ ] USB shell connected to GND via ESD path
- [ ] All test points labeled
